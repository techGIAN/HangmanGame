Hangman Game in HTML/JavaScript

About:
Played around with some of the things I have learned from HTML and JavaScript and applied it in making this simple Hangman Game

Game Instructions:
- Click "New Game" to begin.
- In the box, type in any letter to make a guess.
- Make as many guesses as you can until you win or run out of guesses (and lose).
- You win if you guess the word correctly.
